      <h2>Border Collie</h2>

      <p>Border Collies consistently top rankings for intelligence in dogs. They have been bred for herding sheep, a job which
      many still do today, and that is no easy task. With just a few commands from their handler, they need to be able to make
      quick decisions to drive the sheep where they need to go, work with other dogs and the shepherd to ensure the sheep end
      up where they are meant to be.
      
      Combined with their agility and speed, Border Collies are built for canine sports like agility, obedience, canicross and
      disc dog, as well as making wonderful companions.
      
      One Border Collie named Chaser could identify and retrieve 1,022 toys by their name in tests, the most any non-human
      animal has achieved in a study. Chaser also demonstrated an understanding of grammar and an ability to infer the name of
      a new object by excluding the objects that she already knew – pretty smart if you ask us!</p>

      <h2>Poodle</h2>

        alt="img2">
      <p>Some people may think that the Poodle is nothing more than a showy dog on the arms of the upper classes – but they’d be
      wrong. Like many of the other dogs on this list, the Poodle is a gun dog, one that specialises in retrieving game from
      water. They needed to be able to think on their feet and navigate tricky terrain – their smarts came in handy!
      
      The Poodle can put its paw to many jobs and canine sports – from assistance dogs to agility pros, they excel at all
      sorts, as well as making wonderful canine companions.</p>

      <h2>German Shepherd</h2>

      <p>The noble German Shepherd is famous for its role as a police dog – but it was originally bred to herd sheep and protect
      them from predators and threats. Like the other herding dogs on this list, owners of working German Shepherds needed
      them to be intelligent and capable of making independent decisions as well as understanding their handler’s commands.</p>
